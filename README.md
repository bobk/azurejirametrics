# Project Title

**Simple Jira Agile Metrics via Python and SQL (and Azure)**

## Description

This example code set demonstrates easy access to the Jira API via Python (jira-python) and the creation of simple MS SQL tables using that API to generate useful Jira Agile metrics via simple SQL queries and joins.

[See PowerPoint presentation here (in \docs subdir)](https://github.com/bobk/azurejirametrics/blob/master/docs)

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

To run the Python scripts stand-alone, you need a machine capable of running Python 3.x scripts, along with pyodbc and jira-python, as well as a Microsoft SQL Server reachable via ODBC.

To run the Python scripts in Azure, you need either a container (sample dockerfile provided) or a VM capable of the above.
